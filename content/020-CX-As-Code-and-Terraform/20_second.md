## What is Terraform

Terraform is a tool for building and managing infrastructures. It takes in configuration files, which specify how the resources should be set up and configured. Terraform will generate an execution plan describing what needs to be done to reach the desired state. Terraform then applies the plan and builds the specified infrastructure. When new changes are made to the configuration files, Terraform is able to detect differences and generate incremental execution plans for changes.â€‹
